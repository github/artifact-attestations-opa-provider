# Policy tests

The example policies in the OPA Gatekeeper constraint files are also
defined in [policies.rego], with added unit tests. These policies are
the ones that are copied into the [constraint
templates](../validation).

These tests and example data provide a great starting place for users
that want to customize the policies, and would like to have the
opportunity to test the policy on real data.
